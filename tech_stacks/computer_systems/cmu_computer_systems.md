# Notes of CMU - Intro to Computer Systems

## 1 Bits, Bytes, and Ints

What we want to understand is what is the bit level representation of numbers. And how does that affect some of the properties you have when you operate then on, and especially looking at the corner cases when things overflow. We sort of don't do what, you might expect them to do.

### 1.1 Representing information as bits

### 1.1.1 Everything is bits

- **Each bit is 0 or 1**
- **By encoding/interpreting sets of bits in various ways**
  - Computers determine what to do (instructions)
  - ...and represent and manipulate nunbers, sets, strings, etc...
- **Why bits? Eletronic Inplementation**
  - Easy to store with bitstable elements
  - Reliably transmitted on noisy and inaccurate wires

### 1.2 Bit-level manipulations

### 1.3 Integers

#### 1.3.1 Representation: unsigned and signed

#### 1.3.2 Conversion, casting

#### 1.3.3 Expanding, truncating

#### 1.3.4 Addtion, negation, multipliation, shifting

#### 1.3.5 Summary

### 1.4 Representations in memory, pointers and strings
